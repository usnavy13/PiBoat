# Autonomous Boat Project 

An autonomous boat system built with Python and running on a Raspberry Pi.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an autonomous boat capable of navigating waterways independently using a Raspberry Pi as the main controller. The boat will use various sensors for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and data collection.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (3B+ or 4 recommended)
- Motor controller
- Propulsion system (motors, propellers)
- Power supply (batteries)
- Sensors (GPS, compass, ultrasonic, etc.)
- Waterproof enclosure

## Software Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (to be documented)
- Raspberry Pi OS

## Setup Instructions

Instructions for setting up the hardware and software will be added as the project progresses.

## Usage

Usage instructions will be provided once the project reaches a functional state.
